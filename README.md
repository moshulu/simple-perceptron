# simple-perceptron
This project is aimed to efficiently implement the perceptron algorithm, an algorithm that models linear classification of datasets.

### This implementation's data
This is how I knew that the perceptron algorithm was working correctly. These slides are copyright of Dr. Ling Zheng, and apart of Monmouth University's coursework.
